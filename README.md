# Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

### Description

An end-to-end project with the goal of creating a simple sentiment analysis app that determines whether a user-inputted movie review is positive or negative. The final version of the app can be found [here](https://denzel-movie-sentiment-app.herokuapp.com)

### Background

There are many sites where people can write their own reviews and opinions on newly released movie productions, eg. IMDB and Metacritic. Rotten Tomatoes in particular is a commonly used review platform and makes use of a binary rating system for its critic reviews; where 'fresh' means a positive review and 'rotten' means negative. In general, positive reviews largely consist of language that suggest a positive sentiment towards the movie and, conversely, negative reviews consist of language that suggest a negative sentiment. Using this as inspiration, I decided to try and use machine learning to automate the classification of positive and negative reviews using sentiment analysis.
